Game will be a 3D platformer built using Unity, concept still in the works.
However, it may have an animal main character like a sheepdog that has to go collect sheep that wandered off.
-Dog will walk, run and jump  
-Explore and find the sheep in the 3d world (could add time limit feature)
-Once a sheep is found it will follow the dog back to its home, could get distracted and wonder off again 
-Possible additions: wolves that attack the sheep, bark to scare off wolves, interact with other farm animals
